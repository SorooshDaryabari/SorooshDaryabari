# 💫 About Me:
Thank you for visiting my profile🙏<br>
Maybe you want to know something about me, Who am I?🧐<br>
I am a Python🐍 developer😃 and I am very interested in this language.<br>
Because it is a very powerful and useful language😎<br>
I use the Django framework, a powerful Python framework that makes web development with this language very easy.<br>
I also use graphql and Django Rest Framework to write APIs. It is really enjoyable😍<br>
I have knowledge in html, css and javascript, but not as much as my favorite language, Python.<br>
My favorite operating system is Linux and I have been using it for about a year.
<br>I am 19 years old and a student at Payam Noor University.👨‍🎓
<br>
I've worked with python for 3 years and django for about 2 years and I've been a Linux user for about a year.
